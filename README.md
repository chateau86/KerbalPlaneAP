###Spurrry AP

This is a new autopilot plugin for Kerbal Space Program. This project is meant to be a spaceplane-oriented alternative to MechJeb. 

Currently, only the roll and pitch hold function are implemented. However, This project is designed to be modular from the begining. This will allow new functions to be easily implemented.

As of now, the part file is not included. So just compile it with your choice of C# compiler and then add
    MODULE
    {
        name = KTP2

    }
to your choice of part and put the compiled dll in '<KSPFolder>\GameData\<YourPart>\Plugins'. 

Now you aer ready to fly your plane like a *REAL* pilot. No more stomping-the-rudder-pedal to turn like MechJeb.

Thank you.
